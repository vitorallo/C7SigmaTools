// Title: Service Binary in User Controlled Folder
// Author: Nasreddine Bencherchali (Nextron Systems), Florian Roth (Nextron Systems)

// Level: medium
// Description: Detects the setting of the "ImagePath" value of a service registry key to a path controlled by a non-administrator user such as "\AppData\" or "\ProgramData\".
// Attackers often use such directories for staging purposes.
// This rule might also trigger on badly written software, where if an attacker controls an auto starting service, they might achieve persistence or privilege escalation.
// Note that while ProgramData is a user controlled folder, software might apply strict ACLs which makes them only accessible to admin users. Remove such folders via filters if you experience a lot of noise.
