// Query #1: get machines that have used a given local IP address at a given time - as configured on their network adapters.
// Required Connectors: MicrosoftThreatProtection (Types: DeviceInfo)

// Query #3: get machines that have used a given *public* IP address at a given time - as seen in their communications with the WDATP cloud
