// Description: The following queries pivot from an IP address assigned to a machine to the relevant machine or logged-on users.
// To read more about it, check out this post: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/What-s-New/Advanced-hunting-now-includes-network-adapters-information/m-p/224402#M74.
// Query #1: get machines that have used a given local IP address at a given time - as configured on their network adapters.
// Required Connectors: MicrosoftThreatProtection (Types: DeviceNetworkInfo, DeviceInfo)

// Query #4: Get machines that have used a given IP address, looking up on both local and external addresses.
//           This includes IP addresses seen locally in their network adapters configuration or ones used to access the WDATP cloud.
