// Description: First query digs in print spooler drivers folder for any file creations,
// MANY OF THE FILES THAT SHOULD COME UP HERE MAY BE LEGIT. Unsigned files
// or ones that don't have any relations to printers that you are using are
// suspicious.
// Second query that can be used for finding client machines that
// could be operating print servers or file servers is also included here.
// As additional mitigation for the exploit you might want to block the
// incoming traffic to the SMB or EPMAP Ports (445) if you need to keep the
// spooler service running to print from clients.
// Required Connectors: MicrosoftThreatProtection (Types: DeviceNetworkEvents)
