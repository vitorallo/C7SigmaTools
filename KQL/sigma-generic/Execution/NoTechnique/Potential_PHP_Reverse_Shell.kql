// Title: Potential PHP Reverse Shell
// Author: @d4ns4n_
// Date: 2023-04-07
// Level: high
// Description: Detects usage of the PHP CLI with the "-r" flag which allows it to run inline PHP code. The rule looks for calls to the "fsockopen" function which allows the creation of sockets.
// Attackers often leverage this in combination with functions such as "exec" or "fopen" to initiate a reverse shell connection.
