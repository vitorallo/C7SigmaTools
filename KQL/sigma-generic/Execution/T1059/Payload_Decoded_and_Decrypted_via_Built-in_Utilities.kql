// Title: Payload Decoded and Decrypted via Built-in Utilities
// Author: Tim Rauch (rule), Elastic (idea)

// Level: medium
// Description: Detects when a built-in utility is used to decode and decrypt a payload after a macOS disk image (DMG) is executed. Malware authors may attempt to evade detection and trick users into executing malicious code by encoding and encrypting their payload and placing it in a disk image file. This behavior is consistent with adware or malware families such as Bundlore and Shlayer.
