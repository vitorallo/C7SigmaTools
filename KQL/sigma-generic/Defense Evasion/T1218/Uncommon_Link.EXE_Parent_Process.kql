// Description: Detects an uncommon parent process of "LINK.EXE".
// Link.EXE in Microsoft incremental linker. Its a utility usually bundled with Visual Studio installation.
// Multiple utilities often found in the same folder (editbin.exe, dumpbin.exe, lib.exe, etc) have a hardcode call to the "LINK.EXE" binary without checking its validity.
// This would allow an attacker to sideload any binary with the name "link.exe" if one of the aforementioned tools get executed from a different location.
// By filtering the known locations of such utilities we can spot uncommon parent process of LINK.EXE that might be suspicious or malicious.
