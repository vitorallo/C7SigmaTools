// Author: Beyu Denis, oscd.community, Nasreddine Bencherchali (Nextron Systems)

// Level: medium
// Description: Detects the execution of "DXCap.EXE" with the "-c" flag, which allows a user to launch any arbitrary binary or windows package through DXCap itself. This can be abused to potentially bypass application whitelisting.
